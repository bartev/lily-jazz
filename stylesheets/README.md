# Stylesheets README

To use in the docker image, copy these files to
lilypond-docker/plugins/bv-lilyjazz/stylesheets.

To use in general, copy to the LilyPond path.

I think it goes here:

/Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/share/lilypond/current/ly

(search path:
 `/Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/share/lilypond/2.20.0/fonts/svg/:
/Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/share/lilypond/2.20.0/fonts/type1/:
/Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/share/lilypond/2.20.0/fonts/otf/:
/Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/share/lilypond/2.20.0/scm:
/Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/share/lilypond/2.20.0/ps:
