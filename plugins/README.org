Where files go.
https://lilypond.org/doc/v2.22/Documentation/learning/other-sources-of-information

* Docker

To use in the docker image, copy these files to
=lilypond-docker/plugins/bv-lilyjazz/stylesheets=

* Mac (non-brew install)
To use in general, copy to the LilyPond path.

I think it goes here:

=/Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/share/lilypond/current/ly=

(search path:
 `/Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/share/lilypond/2.20.0/fonts/svg/:
/Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/share/lilypond/2.20.0/fonts/type1/:
/Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/share/lilypond/2.20.0/fonts/otf/:
/Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/share/lilypond/2.20.0/scm:
/Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/share/lilypond/2.20.0/ps:
/Applications/LilyPond.app/Contents/Resources/share/lilypond/2.20.0/ly:
y')

* Mac (brew install)

With a homebrew install, check in =/usr/local/Cellar/= or =/usr/local/opt/=

* Adding custom functions

Add custom =*.ily= files to [[file:bv-lilyjazz/stylesheets/]].
Then run the setup script ([[file:setup-custom-lily-files.sh]])
This will install the files in the current install location.
(Note: Current install is via homebrew - 2022-10-23)
