LilyPond 2.19.32 released  _November 22, 2015_
----------------------------------------------

We are happy to announce the release of LilyPond 2.19.32.  This release
includes a number of enhancements, and contains some work in progress.
You will have access to the very latest features, but some may be
incomplete, and you may encounter bugs and crashes.  If you require a
stable version of Lilypond, we recommend using the 2.18 version.

Lilypond 2.18.2 released!  _March 23, 2014_
-------------------------------------------

We are proud to announce the release of GNU LilyPond 2.18.2.  LilyPond
is a music engraving program devoted to producing the highest-quality
sheet music possible.  It brings the aesthetics of traditionally
engraved music to computer printouts.

   This version provides a number of updates to 2.18.0, including
updated manuals.  We recommend all users to upgrade to this version.

LilyPond production named BEST EDITION 2014  _March 11, 2014_
-------------------------------------------------------------

We are thrilled that the edition of the songs of Oskar Fried
(1871-1941), published recently by our fellow contributors Urs Liska
and Janek Warchoł [1], received the "Musikeditionspreis BEST EDITION
2014" of the German Music Publishers' Association [2].  The ceremony
took place at the Frankfurt Musikmesse.

   We congratulate Janek and Urs for gaining such public recognition of
typographical and editorial excellence of their work.  We are also
delighted to inform you that they intend to make their work available
under a Free license as soon as the publisher expenses are covered.
Please support this initiative by buying the printed volume through the
publisher [3].

Lilypond 2.18.0 released!  _December 29, 2013_
----------------------------------------------

We are proud to announce the release of GNU LilyPond 2.18.0.  LilyPond
is a music engraving program devoted to producing the highest-quality
sheet music possible.  It brings the aesthetics of traditionally
engraved music to computer printouts.

   Among the numerous improvements and changes, the following might be
most visible:

   * Many items are now positioned using their actual outline rather
     than a rectangular bounding box.  This greatly reduces the
     occurrence of unsightly large gaps.

   * Sets and overrides can now use the syntax
          \override Voice.TextSpanner.bound-details.left.text = "rit."
     instead of the previous
          \override Voice.TextSpanner #'(bound-details left text) = "rit."

   * Triplets with a given group length can now be written as
          \tuplet 3/2 4 { c8 c c  c c c }
     instead of
          \times 2/3 { c8 c c }  \times 2/3 { c8 c c }

   A full list of noteworthy new features is given in:

     `http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/changes/index.html'

financial backing enabled one core developer, David Kastrup, to focus

We are proud to announce the release of GNU LilyPond 2.14.  LilyPond is

engraved music to computer printouts.

   Many improvements have been made in the past two and a half years
since the previous main stable version.  A few major improvements are:

   * LilyPond is now licensed under the GNU GPL v3 or higher.

   * The vertical spacing engine has been drastically changed, making
     it much more flexible and easier to control.

   * Automatic beaming is now more flexible, and beam collisions are
     avoided.


   A full list of new features is given in:

-------------

LilyPond 2.5.14 is out. It is now possible (and in fact, encouraged),
to build LilyPond either without the Kpathsea TeX library or with the
Kpathsea dynamically loaded, but only for the -btex backend.  This
means that packages do not have to depend on TeX anymore. With this,
the Windows download size will go down significantly. Take a look at
the *note Changes:: file and download *note Old downloads::!

Ghostscript 8.15rc3
(http://lilypond.org/download/binaries/Fedora-3/ghostscript-8.15rc3-0.i386.rpm).
Unfortunately, this version of Ghostscript lacks the IJS dynamic
library, which means that it will conflict with the gimp-print package.
You may install it with -nodeps. Use at your own risk.

integration for the PS backend. The default font is Century Schoolbook
from the PS font suite.  It also has small updates to the tablature
settings by Erlend Aasland, assorted manual updates by Graham, and an
overhaul of the font code by Werner.  *note Old downloads:: and check

January 02, 2005
----------------

LilyPond 2.5.6 was released. This is a "technology preview" release,
which means that it has all kinds of nifty features, but is not
actually usable for producing nicely printed scores. For this reason,
an RPM of this release was not produced. The PS backend is now
completely switched over to Pango/FontConfig: for -f ps, LilyPond only
accepts UTF8 input, all text fonts are loaded through Pango, the TeX
backend now offloads all metric computations to LaTeX, the SVG and
GNOME backends are broken, most probably.  *note Old downloads:: and

December 28, 2004
-----------------

LilyPond 2.5.5 is out. It is the first one to link against FontConfig
and Pango, although it is only available in the "-f ps" output. The
default output format has been changed back TeX while we stabilize the
Pango/FontConfig integration.  *note Old downloads:: and check out the

December 20, 2004
-----------------

LilyPond 2.5.4 is out. This release has some major brainsurgery in the
font handling. As of now, LilyPond loads the music fonts in OpenType
font format using FreeType.  This has made a lot of things simpler,
including font handling for the GNOME backend and SVG backend.  *note

December 3, 2004
----------------

LilyPond 2.5.3 was released. A new script, `\espressivo' has been
added, for a combination of crescendo and decrescendo on a single note.
In markups, expressions stacked with `\column', `\center-align', etc,
are not grouped with `< ...  >' anymore, but with `{ ... }'. LilyPond
will now avoid line breaks that cause long texts to stick outside of
the page staff. Grace notes following a main note, used to be entered
by letting the grace notes follow a skip in a parallel expression.

November 26, 2004
-----------------

LilyPond 2.5.2 was released. It has several goodies, including
solfa-notation (shaped noteheads), and an easier mechanism for
customizing title, footer and header layout. Don't forget to rebuild
the fonts, as they have been changed to accomodate the solfa-notation.

November 20, 2004
-----------------

LilyPond 2.5.1 is out. This is an experimental release, containing some
proof-of-concept code for our graphical layout editor. You can add and
remove things from the file, and the tweaks will still work, as long as
the tweaked notes remain in the place (ie. start at the same time-wise
and be part of the same context). Further attractions are: the gnome
backend now also draws beams and slurs, updates to the SVG backend,
support for the lmodern font set for TeX, various bugfixes.  *note Old
downloads:: and check out the changes in the ChangeLog
(http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/*checkout*/lilypond/lilypond/ChangeLog?rev=1.2881&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup).

November 12, 2004
-----------------

The LilyPond development is OPEN once again! The first release of the
2.5 series has the following new Features: Positioning of slurs can now
be adjusted manually, Grace notes are correctly quoted and formatted
when using cue notes, Cue notes can now be created with

\cueDuring #VOICE-NAME #DIRECTION { MUSIC }

 Stemlets (short stems over beamed rests) have been added.  In
addition, Jan hacked together some highly experimental code where you
can use the mouse to drag and drop objects in the -f gnome backend.
These tweaks can be saved and are applied to the PS and TeX output as
well.  *note Old downloads:: and check out the changes in the ChangeLog

----------------

LilyPond 2.3.22 fixes a bunch more bugs, to make 2.4 a really stable

----------------

LilyPond 2.3.20 was released. It fixes the biggest problems with
encoding and the TeX backend. As a result, latin1 characters (like the
german SS) show up correctly in the output once again. Also it has the
usual bugfixes and updates in the documentation.  *note Old downloads::

September 20, 2004
------------------

LilyPond 2.3.18 was released. It has further improvements in the slur
formatting, and a small syntax change: the mode changing commands
(`\chords', `\lyrics', etc.)  have been renamed to `\chordmode',
`\lyricmode', etc. The command `\chords' is an abbreviation for \new
ChordNames \chordmode ...  `\drums', `\lyrics', `\chords', `\figures'
function similarly.  *note Old downloads:: and check out the changes in

September 11, 2004
------------------

LilyPond 2.3.16 was released. It fixes a couple of annoying bugs, and
has an important addition in the slur-formatter. Slurs that pass note
heads much closer than the average distance get an extra penalty. This
fixes a lot of difficult slurring cases. See input/regression/new-slur
for some examples.  Please consider this release as a 3.0 pre-release
so try to find as many bugs as possible. A report including a small .ly
example can be filed at bug-lilypond@gnu.org In this case, a bug is
defined as something that the current 2.3 does worse than the latest
2.2 release.  We want to be sure that no output will get uglier by
upgrading to 3.0, so that once 3.0 is out, nothing will hold users back
in switching.  *note Old downloads:: and check out the changes in the

September 10, 2004
------------------

LilyPond 2.3.15 was released. It fixes for some gaffes with the new
vertical spacing engine, has lots of documentation updates, and has
support for landscape output in the direct postscript output. Also, the
types of events quoted with `\quote' can now be tuned with
`quotedEventTypes'. By default, only notes and rests end up in quotes.

September 6, 2004
-----------------

LilyPond 2.3.14 was released and has exciting features!  LilyPond will
try to keep staves at the same distances across a page, but it will
stretch distances to prevent collisions; key signature cancellations
are now printed before the bar line; different voices that all use
"\quote" can now refer to each other.  *note Old downloads:: and check

August 29, 2004
---------------

LilyPond now has a Documentation Editor, Graham Percival. From now on,
he will oversee that useful information flows from the mailiing list
into the manual. Also, if there are unclear sections in the manual, let
him know via one of the mailing lists.  As a start of his career, he
worked to transform the "Templates" section of the website into a
readable and comprehensive chapter of the user manual.  A lot of cheers
for Graham!

August 29, 2004
---------------

LilyPond 2.3.13 was released. The new slur code was improved, scripts
can be made to avoid slurs, by setting inside-slur to #f. It is no
longer necessary to instantiate "up" and "down" staves separately when
using \autochange. Jurgen Reuter refreshed the logic around mensural
flags, so they are adjusted for staff lines once again.  *note Old

August 1, 2004
--------------

LilyPond 2.3.10 is out. This release has a major clean-up of the
input/test/ directory. Many examples have been moved to the regression
test or manual, and the superfluous or outdated ones have been removed.
The directory has gone from 146 examples to 72 examples. That means
that we're halfway cleaning it out.  Incidentally, the manual has gone
from 200 to 220 pages. New features:
   * Running trills now have their own spanner and event. They are
     started and stopped with \startTrillSpan and \stopTrillSpan

   * There is a new markup command `\postscript' that takes a string
     that is dumped as verbatim PostScript

-------------

LilyPond 2.3.9 is out.  The important change is that lilypond now
once-again directly runs the binary. The old wrapper script has been
renamed to lilypond-latex.py, and should only be used for legacy
projects. The recommended route is either using lilypond directly (with
\book, you can have multiple movements within one document), or to run
lilypond-book with a LaTeX wrapper file.  This release also fixes a
bunch of small errors.  I now consider LilyPond feature complete for a
3.0 release.  Next on the TODO list is updating the manual, and after
that's done we can release 3.0. The projected date for this to happen
is in about a month.  *note Old downloads:: and check out the changes

-------------

LilyPond 2.3.8 fixes a few minor bugs in the new slur code, and has
rewritten support for ledger lines. Now, in tight situations, ledger
lines will be shortened so they stay separate.  This also required a
cleanup of the Ambitus implementation.  *note Old downloads:: and check

-------------

LilyPond 2.3.7 was released and has new exciting features!  The slur
formatting has been rewritten. The new slur code works similar to the
Beam formatter: scores are assigned for all esthetic components of a
slur. A large number of combinations for begin and end points is then
tried out.  Slurs will now also take into account collisions with staff
lines, scripts (like staccato and accent) and accidentals. In the
LilyPond emacs mode, the `|' will now display the current beat within
the measure.  *note Old downloads:: and check out the changes in the
